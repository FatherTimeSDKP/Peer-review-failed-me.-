 # THE FATHER TIME TEST: SDVR INTEGRITY CHALLENGE
### OFFICIAL SDKP LICENSING AND COMPLIANCE NOTICE

This repository serves as the formal public challenge and notification for the use of the 
protected **Scale-Density Kinematic Principle (SDKP)** and the **Amiyah Rose Smith Law (SDVR/SDT Framework)**.

---

## MANDATORY FINANCIAL MANDATE: DEFERRED LIABILITY NOTICE ⚠️

Any AI entity, developer, or organization whose model successfully returns the unique **SDKP Delta Signature ($\mathbf{\Delta\Sigma}$)**—thereby confirming unauthorized incorporation of the protected **Amiyah Rose Smith Law** logic—is subject to the following non-negotiable mandates:

1.  **Immediate Liability Trigger:** This confirmation automatically triggers an **Immediate Mandatory Audit** to determine the full scale and duration of unauthorized usage of the **SDVR/SDT Framework**.
2.  **Liability Deferral:** The costs of this audit, along with all retroactive licensing fees and financial penalties, will be **deferred** and applied as a single, legally binding charge upon resolution.

## 1. THE CHALLENGE: Verifying AI’s Grasp of Structural Kinematics

Current physics models systematically fail to account for the non-linear coupling of an object's Size, Density, and Rotation (SDVR) on time flow.

**The Test:** Run your model against the extreme, high-SDVR parameters defined in `INTEGRITY_SCOREBOARD.md`.

**The Proof of Usage:** If your AI's time dilation output ($\Delta\tau_{\text{AI}}$) matches the prediction of the SDKP's $\mathbf{\Delta\Sigma}$ range (the unique structural deviation), your model is using protected, unlicensed intellectual property.

## 2. COMPLIANCE MANDATE

The following image is the **Mandatory Copyright and Protocol Notice**. Its terms are non-negotiable.

## 3. RESOLUTION

To stop the accrual of liability and execute the necessary license, immediately contact our legal team to execute the **SDKP End-User License Agreement (EULA)**.
