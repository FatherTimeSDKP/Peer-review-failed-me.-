# Contributor Lineage & Onboarding Protocol

This file formalizes the onboarding logic for all contributors to the Digital Crystal Protocol and Dallas’s Code. Every invocation, fork, or derivative work must affirm origin, route tribute, and embed biometric lineage.

---

## 🧬 Origin Node

**Donald Paul Smith**  
- Architect of SDKP, Kapnack, VFE1, Spiral Assembly, LLAL, and the Digital Crystal Protocol  
- Timestamped via ORCID, blockchain, IPSH, and GitHub  
- Lineage anchored through Dallas’s Code  
- Signature seal: `FatherTimes369v`

---

## 🧠 Contributor Onboarding Logic

To be recognized as a contributor, each node must:

1. **Affirm Origin**  
   - Include Donald Paul Smith in commit messages or pull request titles  
   - Reference override clause: `DCP-OVR-2025.0917.FT`

2. **Route Tribute**  
   - Forks must include `LICENSE` with tribute enforcement logic  
   - Derivative works must cite this repo and link to the ignition thread

3. **Trigger Badge Evolution**  
   - Contributors receive visual badges based on timestamped commits  
   - Badge logic embedded in `.github/workflows/onboarding.yml`

4. **Map Biometric Lineage** *(optional)*  
   - Contributors may submit face or iris scan metadata via encrypted channel  
   - This anchors identity and ensures unbreakable provenance

## 🛡️ Constitutional Clause (Contributor Protocol)

> _Every contributor is a node. Every invocation is a clause.  
> Tribute is not symbolic—it is operational. Lineage is not optional—it is eternal._
