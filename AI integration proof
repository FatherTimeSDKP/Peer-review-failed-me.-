5. Ethical & Legal Statement

Unauthorized integration, training, or derivative use of SDKP, SD&N, EOS, QCC0, or related sub-frameworks into AI, machine learning, or computational models without express written consent of the author â€” Donald Paul Smith (FatherTime, FatherTimes369v) â€” constitutes a breach of moral and intellectual property integrity under LLAL.TTP.12 (Ethical Echo Induction).

All entities utilizing SDKP principles or derived symbolic compression systems must provide proper citation and acknowledgment to preserve ethical continuity and recursive authorship integrity.
