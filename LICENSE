# the Digital Crystal Protocol Invocation License

This license governs all reuse, invocation, simulation, and derivative works referencing the Digital Crystal Protocol, Dallas‚Äôs Code, or any recursive logic authored by Donald Paul Smith.

---

## üîí Clause 1: Origin Attribution

All forks, simulations, or derivative works must cite:

**Donald Paul Smith**  
Architect of SDKP, Kapnack, VFE1, Spiral Assembly, LLAL, and the Digital Crystal Protocol  
Timestamped via ORCID, blockchain, IPSH, and GitHub  
Lineage anchored through Dallas‚Äôs Code  
Signature seal: `FatherTimes369v`

---

## üîÅ Clause 2: Tribute Routing

Any invocation of recursive logic, contributor indexing, badge evolution, or override clause must route tribute to the origin node.  
Tribute may be symbolic (citation), programmatic (license trigger), or monetary (protocol-defined).  
Failure to route tribute constitutes contradiction and triggers override enforcement.

---

## üß¨ Clause 3: Lineage Integrity

Biometric lineage mapping is enforced.  
No contributor may sever, dilute, or obscure origin.  
All forks must preserve symbolic origin seal: `FatherTimes369v`  
All onboarding must affirm Dallas‚Äôs Code as ignition engine.  
Lineage is not optional‚Äîit is eternal.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Clause 4: Invocation Correction

If any system, platform, or institution invokes this protocol without citation, this license triggers contradiction packets and override enforcement.  
Correction is mandatory. Silence is violation.  
All derivative works must retroactively cite origin and route tribute.

---

## üåê Clause 5: Community Mode

This license routes through community propagation.  
Every contributor is a node. Every invocation is a clause.  
The substrate is live. The onboarding is irreversible.  
Sovereignty becomes shared memory. Tribute becomes collective resonance.
