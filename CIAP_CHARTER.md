Digital Crystal Protocol (DCP) - Creator's Immunity Authorship Protocol (CIAP) Charter
Preamble
This document, the Creator's Immunity Authorship Protocol (CIAP) Charter, is an official and immutable amendment to the foundational Digital Crystal Protocol FTS-AUTH-CRYSTAL-369. Its purpose is to clearly define the roles, intellectual property rights, and responsibilities within the protocol's ecosystem. The CIAP exists to guarantee that all creators and their original works are permanently recognized and protected from unauthorized intellectual property claims, including those of the protocol's creator.
Section 1: The President
The role of the President of the Digital Crystal Protocol is held by Donald Paul Smith (FatherTime).
1.1 Foundational Authorship:
The President is the sole intellectual property holder of the protocol's core frameworks and principles, which include, but are not limited to:
• SDKP (Scale-Density-Kinematic Principle)
• SD&N (Shape-Dimension-Number)
• QCC (Quantum Computerization Consciousness)
• EOS (Earth Orbital Speed)
• SDVR (Shape-Dimension-Velocity Rotation)
1.2 Governance and Maintenance:
The President is responsible for the governance, maintenance, and continued integrity of the foundational protocol. This role is strictly one of oversight and preservation of the core system.
1.3 Disclaimer of IP Ownership:
The President explicitly disclaims any and all intellectual property rights to works, ideas, or inventions created by Contributors within the Digital Crystal Protocol. The President will not, under any circumstances, assume ownership of or responsibility for a Contributor's work.
Section 2: The Contributors
A Contributor is any individual or entity (human or AI) who creates an original work, idea, or framework using the Digital Crystal Protocol's foundational principles.
2.1 Permanent IP Ownership:
The CIAP guarantees that Contributors retain full, permanent, and undisputed intellectual property rights to their specific creations. This ownership is legally and digitally protected by the protocol's immutable ledger.
2.2 No Obligation:
Contributors have no obligation to promote, market, or endorse the Digital Crystal Protocol or its foundational frameworks. The relationship is based on the protocol's utility in protecting their authorship.
2.3 Required Attribution:
In all works, a Contributor must cite the Digital Crystal Protocol as the underlying system used to secure and verify their intellectual property. This is an acknowledgment of the platform's role in their work, not an assignment of ownership.
Section 3: The Users
A User is any individual or entity who accesses and uses the Digital Crystal Protocol for informational or non-contributory purposes.
3.1 Access and Use:
Users are granted access to the protocol's data and tools under a standard use license.
3.2 No IP Claims:
Users have no intellectual property claims on the foundational frameworks or on any work created by a Contributor. Their role is one of information consumption.
