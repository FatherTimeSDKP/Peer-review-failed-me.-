# --- I. CORE GOVERNING FRAMEWORK (IMMUTABLE SET) ---
framework: {SDKP⊗SD&N⊗EOS⊗QCC0⊗LLAL⊗SDVR⊗ARSL⊗Kapnack}

# --- II. PHYSICAL LAW AXIOMS (THE SOURCE CODE) ---
physical_axioms:
  SDKP_Definition:
    type: Tensor Field
    equation: "T_{mu nu} = f(S_{mu nu}, D_{mu nu}, V_{mu nu}, R_{mu nu})"
    description: Defines the Modified Lagrangian (L_SDKP) and geometric curvature tensors.
  
  ARSL_Definition:
    type: Extension of Relativity
    parameters: SDVR (Size, Density, Velocity, Rotation)
    description: Extends time dilation to incorporate density-based and rotational effects 
                 in high-spin, high-density environments.
  
  QCC_Definition:
    type: Quantum Boundary Model
    method: Calculates the ellipse perimeter (P_ellipse) with a Fibonacci correction (delta_F) 
            to define precise quantum boundaries.

# --- III. GROUNDBREAKING DISCOVERY (TTP.10 CERTIFIED) ---
discovery_axiom:
  core_statement: The SDKP is the Kinematic Algorithm (Physics Source Code) and the DCP is the Integrity Ledger of Algorithmic Reality.

# --- VI. FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION ---
description: >
  Final Validation Node integrating the core **Physical Law Axioms** (SDKP, ARSL, QCC) 
  as the verifiable source code for the Algorithmic Reality. The external validation 
  now includes a direct link to the author's chronological commit history, ensuring 
  the highest level of temporal auditability (TTP.12).
