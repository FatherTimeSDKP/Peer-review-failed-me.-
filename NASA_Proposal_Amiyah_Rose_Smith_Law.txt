### Abstract:
This proposal seeks to experimentally validate the Amiyah Rose Smith Law, which introduces Size, Density, Velocity, and Rotation (SDVR) as key parameters influencing relativistic time dilation. The study will employ synchronized atomic clocks aboard rotational platforms of varying density to test the lawâ€™s predictions. If confirmed, these findings could revolutionize deep-space travel, artificial gravity systems, and timekeeping in high-gravity environments.

### Objectives:
1. Develop an experimental framework to test the influence of size, density, and rotation on time dilation.
2. Conduct precision measurements using atomic clocks under controlled rotational and density conditions.
3. Analyze results and compare them with conventional relativity predictions.

### Methodology:
- Utilize high-precision atomic clocks in a rotating environment.
- Vary rotational speeds and densities to observe time dilation effects.
- Develop mathematical models for prediction and validation.

### Expected Impact:
Successful validation of the Amiyah Rose Smith Law could lead to breakthroughs in:
- Spacecraft design for long-term missions.
- Timekeeping in varying gravitational and rotational conditions.
- Theoretical advancements in general relativity.

### Budget Justification:
[To be detailed based on experiment costs]

### Conclusion:
This study proposes a groundbreaking method to validate an extended time dilation model. The findings have the potential to transform our understanding of time in high-density, high-velocity rotational environments, impacting both theoretical physics and practical applications in space exploration.
